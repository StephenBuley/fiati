# Fiati music font

Fiati is an OpenType music font with fingering diagram/chart for multiple musical instruments. Because mainly wind instruments need those diagrams for teaching and learning, we have decided to call this font _fiati_ ("winds" in Italian, the abbreviation for that instrument category).

## Introduction

Fiati is based in the fingering section from [Bravura font v0.93](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/bravura/issues/2) and the [SMuFL documentation](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/smufl/tree/de7aa579d647c992aa020d326861327a469f2dde/doc), so most of the credit for this font goes to [Daniel Spreadbury](https://github.com/dspreadbury) from Steinberg Media.

## Installation

To install the font, it is usually just a case of double-clicking the downloaded [font file](./fonts) and agreeing to the install process. Please, refer to the [usage documentation](./documentation/fiati-usage.md) for more details.
